**Progress Tracking Method:**
- Daily standups with defect review

- GitHub Issues with automated status updates

- Test case execution dashboard in Google Sheets

- Weekly metrics reporting to stakeholders
  
**Change Control Notes:**
- Added 2 additional test cases for scramble validation (approved by PM)

- Extended browser compatibility scope to include mobile Safari (change request #CR-003)

- Postponed performance testing to Phase 2 due to critical defect findings



## Lessons Learned

- Most Defect Prone Feature: 
- Risk Analysis Impact:
a 1-day delay in medium priority testing due to browser compatibility issues

b Two defects requiring immediate attention (DEF-001, DEF-005)

c Accessibility testing taking longer than anticipated
- Team Communication Effectiveness: need to be worked on 
- Improvements for Next Cycle:
 i Complete Firefox compatibility fix (DEF-001)
ii Resolve leaderboard duplicate entries (DEF-005)

iii Finalize scramble solvability testing (TC-SCRAM-002)

iv Complete accessibility audit
